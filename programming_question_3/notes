list of edges
list of vertices

edge {
	id1
	id2
}

complex_vertex {
	num vertices
	list of vertices ids
	list of edges
}


(0) build list of edges and verticies:
	- read line by line (vertex by vertex)
	- create a vertex, create edges, 
		add edges to vertex, 
		if edge with larger num: add edge to list of edges, 
		add vertex to list of vertices

algorithm for min cut:

(1) pick random edge (1,2)
(2) contract vertices 1 and 2
	- create complex_vertex with num_vertices++, and list of verticies including 1 and 2 (adopt first vertex id as id of whole)
	- remove vertices 1 and 2 from list of vertices
	- add complex_vertex to list of vertices
	- change 2 in all edges to be 1 (id of first vertex adopted as id of whole)
		- while changing, if edge is (1,1), then delete (self-edge)
